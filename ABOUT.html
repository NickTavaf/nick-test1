    <h3>I'm a design and technology student who grew up in La and moved to NYC for School, I'm currently attending Parsons School of design for my undergraduate. My main interest is in engineering design and what we can build in a world where almost everything has already been invented and how we can improve on our current design of things. In the future I hope to attend Graduate school for Engineering Design and later work in that one field and work somewhere in my home town La.
